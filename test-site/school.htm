Panabungen School of Arts, Trades and Home Industries is a Technical-Vocational
	School created in 1997 by virtue of Republic Act 8387.<br>
	The school used to be named Tadian school of Arts and Trades, 
	Panabungen annex from its opening in June 1987 until its separation as an
	independent school in 1994. It started with an initial enrolment of 57- 29 males 
	and 23 females. Back then, the school was manned by two permanent and another two 
	casual employees. <br>Based on the latest land survey, the school sits upon a total
	land area of 39, 195 square meters located within barangay Panabungen, Besao, 
	Mt. Province. The said lot was donated by generous individuals namely: Mr. Emiliano
	Pagosto, Mr. Tenis Songaben, Mr. Vicente Balaneg and the St. Bede’s Mission of the
	Episcopal Diocese of Northern Philippines through the intervention of Rev. Bartolomeo
	and wife Arsenia Lingayo.<br>PSATHI is one of the 280 public Technical Vocational
	schools that adopts the Strengthened Technical-vocational Education-Competency 
	Based Curriculum (STVE-CBC). There are four areas of specialization currently offered 
	by the school. These are as follows: Automotive Servicing -NC I, Building Construction/
	Woodworking NC II, Bread and Pastry Production-NCII and Dressmaking-NCII.<br></p>
<p class= "gallery-paragraph-2" style= "font-family: Georgia">
	Recently 
	introduced is beauty care (Cosmetology). The basic qualification of the TVE teachers 
	is TESDA National Certificate II and Assessor’s Methodology I.<br>
	Aside from hurdling the National Achievement test, fourth year students are subjected
	to TESDA skills assessment before graduation. To pass both tests, students have to
	take the core subjects of a regular high school at the same time undergo skills 
	training for two hours daily. Core subjects like English, Science and Math, Araling
	Panlipunan, Filipino and MAPE follow the K to 12 curriculum. However, the last three
	subjects are taken only twice a week thus, the equivalent weight of each is only 
	0.6. Additional mandatory subjects like computer education, trade drawing, and 
	entrepreneurship are likewise taken twice a week.<br>With the implementation 
	of grade 11 last June 2016 and with only two senior high schools deployed to PSATHI,
	the school had to cut down the number of laboratory hours to one hour only. This is
	to enable the junior high school teachers to accommodate the classes of the senior
	high school. <br><br><br></p>
